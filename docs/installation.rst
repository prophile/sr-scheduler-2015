Installation
============

The standard way to install the scheduler is to use Pip.

.. code

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/prophile/sr-scheduler-2015.git

You may also choose to install the tools locally with the ``--user`` option.
You should make sure that ``~/.local/bin`` is in your ``PATH`` variable if you
choose to do that.
